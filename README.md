[Link] https://www.odoo.com/web#id=3364934&cids=3&menu_id=4720&action=4665&active_id=3364897&model=project.task&view_type=form

## Steps to complete the dev
- [X] create a boolean field on the website
- [X] make it visible in views
- [X] if boolean field is check and hide the price add to card button and 'fa-shopping-cart' logo
- [X] Inherit templates and make it conditional
- [X] check for single product and multi products also with multiple views (list and grid)
- [ ] Remove quantity plus-minus buttons as well

## Issues/Blocking points
- [X] Find the views and template id to inherit
- [X] Try to combine qweb in the inherited views
- [X] I did not know how to add condition around a factor at the first time
- [ ] I do not have enough time to finish remove plus minus button

## Topics I need clarification on
- [X] Views attribute syntax
- [X] Qweb and view combination
